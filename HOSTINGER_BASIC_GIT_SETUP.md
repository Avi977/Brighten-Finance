# ðŸš€ Hostinger Basic Git Deployment Guide

## The Problem
Your Hostinger plan doesn't have advanced Git build settings, so it will deploy your source code directly instead of building it first.

## âœ… Solution: Two Options

### Option 1: Use Deployment Folder (Recommended)

**Step 1: Configure Hostinger Git**
```
Repository: https://github.com/Avi977/Byton-Finance.git
Branch: main
Directory: deployment
```
*(Put "deployment" in the Directory field)*

**Step 2: Let GitHub Actions Build**
The workflow I created will:
1. Build your app automatically
2. Put built files in `deployment/` folder
3. Commit them to your repository
4. Hostinger will deploy the `deployment/` folder contents

### Option 2: Manual Build & Upload

**Step 1: Build Locally**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Step 2: Upload via File Manager**
1. Zip the contents of your `out/` folder
2. Upload to Hostinger File Manager
3. Extract to `public_html`

## ðŸ”§ For Option 1 (Automated):

### Hostinger Git Settings:
```
Repository: https://github.com/Avi977/Byton-Finance.git
Branch: main
Directory: deployment
```

### What Happens:
1. You push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions builds your app
3. Built files get committed to `deployment/` folder
4. Hostinger pulls and deploys the `deployment/` folder
5. Your site works! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ”§ For Option 2 (Manual):

### Hostinger Git Settings:
```
Repository: https://github.com/Avi977/Byton-Finance.git
Branch: main
Directory: (leave blank)
```

Then after each deployment:
1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Copy `out/` contents to `public_html` via File Manager

## ðŸš€ Recommended Approach

**Use Option 1** - it's fully automated and you never have to manually upload files again!

Just set the Directory to `deployment` in Hostinger Git settings, and everything will work automatically.

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Setup Steps

1. **Clear your public_html** directory in File Manager
2. **Use these Hostinger Git settings**:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/Avi977/Byton-Finance.git`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Directory: `deployment`
3. **Push this commit** to trigger the build
4. **Wait for GitHub Actions** to build and commit
5. **Redeploy in Hostinger** to get the new files
6. **Your site works!** âœ…

The `deployment/` folder will contain ready-to-serve HTML, CSS, and JS files that work perfectly with basic hosting.
